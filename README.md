# formal-circuits-gpt
Self-refining agent that converts hardware descriptions (Verilog/VHDL) into formal proofs using Large Language Models and deductive search. Based on MIT's "LLM-Assisted Circuit Proofs" research (May 2025), this tool automates the verification of digital circuits using Isabelle and Coq theorem provers.
