# ADR-001: LLM Provider Abstraction Layer

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The formal-circuits-gpt system requires integration with Large Language Models for proof generation and refinement. Multiple LLM providers exist (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models) with different APIs, capabilities, and cost structures. We need a design that allows:

- Support for multiple LLM providers
- Easy switching between providers
- Provider-specific optimizations
- Fallback mechanisms for reliability
- Cost optimization strategies

## Decision
Implement an abstract LLM provider interface with concrete implementations for each supported provider. The abstraction will:

1. Define a common interface for all LLM operations
2. Provide provider-specific implementations
3. Include a provider manager for routing and fallbacks
4. Support provider-specific configuration and optimization

## Rationale
This decision was made to:
- **Avoid vendor lock-in**: Reduce dependency on any single LLM provider
- **Enable cost optimization**: Allow switching based on cost/performance trade-offs
- **Improve reliability**: Implement fallback mechanisms when providers are unavailable
- **Support diverse use cases**: Different providers excel at different tasks
- **Future-proof architecture**: Easy addition of new providers as they emerge

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- Flexibility to use the best provider for each specific task
- Reduced risk of service disruption from provider outages
- Ability to optimize costs by using cheaper providers when appropriate
- Easy integration of new providers as they become available
- Provider-specific optimizations (prompt engineering, parameter tuning)

### Negative Consequences
- Increased code complexity with abstraction layer
- Additional testing required for each provider
- Potential for inconsistent behavior across providers
- More configuration options for users to manage

### Neutral Consequences
- Need for provider-specific configuration management
- Standardization of prompt engineering across providers
- Common error handling and retry logic

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Single Provider (OpenAI only)
- **Pros**: Simplicity, focused optimization
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, single point of failure, limited flexibility
- **Why not chosen**: Too risky for production system

### Alternative 2: Direct Provider Integration
- **Pros**: Maximum control, provider-specific features
- **Cons**: Code duplication, difficult maintenance, no abstraction benefits
- **Why not chosen**: Would create maintenance nightmare

### Alternative 3: Third-party LLM Gateway
- **Pros**: Someone else maintains provider integrations
- **Cons**: Additional dependency, potential limitations, cost
- **Why not chosen**: Prefer direct control for this core component

## Implementation Notes

### Core Interface
```python
class LLMProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def generate_proof(self, prompt: str, context: Dict) -> ProofResponse:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def refine_proof(self, failed_proof: str, error: str) -> ProofResponse:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def supports_feature(self, feature: str) -> bool:
        pass
```

### Provider Manager
- Implement round-robin and failover strategies
- Track provider performance and costs
- Support provider-specific rate limiting
- Provide unified configuration interface

### Configuration Strategy
- Provider credentials via environment variables
- Provider preferences in configuration files
- Runtime provider selection based on task type
- Cost and performance monitoring

## Follow-up Actions
- [ ] Implement base LLMProvider interface
- [ ] Create OpenAI provider implementation
- [ ] Create Anthropic provider implementation
- [ ] Implement provider manager with fallback logic
- [ ] Add provider performance monitoring
- [ ] Create configuration documentation
- [ ] Implement cost tracking and optimization
