# Autonomous SDLC Framework

This document describes the autonomous Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) enhancement framework implemented in this repository.

## Overview

The autonomous SDLC system continuously discovers, prioritizes, and executes the highest-value development tasks through intelligent analysis and adaptive scoring.

## Architecture

### Value Discovery Engine

**Signal Sources:**
- Git history analysis (commit patterns, TODO/FIXME markers)
- Static code analysis (complexity, quality, security)
- Dependency vulnerability tracking
- Performance monitoring integration
- Issue tracker analysis
- User feedback aggregation

**Scoring Model:**
- **WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)**: Business value vs. effort estimation
- **ICE (Impact/Confidence/Ease)**: Strategic impact assessment
- **Technical Debt**: Maintenance burden and growth patterns
- **Security Priority**: Vulnerability risk and compliance requirements

### Adaptive Execution

**Repository Maturity Classification:**
- **Nascent (0-25%)**: Focus on foundational structure
- **Developing (25-50%)**: Enhance testing and CI/CD
- **Maturing (50-75%)**: Add advanced security and monitoring
- **Advanced (75%+)**: Optimize and modernize

**Current Status: Developing (35%)**

### Continuous Learning

The system learns from execution outcomes to improve:
- Effort estimation accuracy
- Value prediction models
- Risk assessment patterns
- Optimal execution strategies

## Configuration

Primary configuration in `.terragon/config.yaml`:

```yaml
scoring:
  weights:
    developing:
      wsjf: 0.5
      ice: 0.2
      technicalDebt: 0.2
      security: 0.1
```

## Execution Schedule

- **Immediate**: On PR merge (value discovery + execution)
- **Hourly**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **Daily**: Comprehensive static analysis
- **Weekly**: Deep architectural assessment
- **Monthly**: Strategic recalibration

## Value Tracking

All metrics stored in `.terragon/value-metrics.json`:

- Execution history and outcomes
- Learning model improvements
- Repository health trends
- Value delivery measurements

## Integration Points

### GitHub Integration
- PR creation with comprehensive context
- Issue tracking for discovered work
- Status checks and quality gates
- Automated review assignment

### Development Workflow
- Pre-commit hook integration
- CI/CD pipeline enhancement

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Gates
- Minimum 80% test coverage
- Security scan passage
- Performance regression limits
- Code quality thresholds

### Rollback Triggers
- Test failures
- Build failures
- Security violations
- Performance degradation

## Success Metrics

### Value Delivery
- Items completed per cycle
