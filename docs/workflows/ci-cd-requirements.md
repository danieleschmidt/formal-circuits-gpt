# CI/CD Workflow Requirements

This document outlines the required GitHub Actions workflows for formal-circuits-gpt.

## Required Workflows

### 1. Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests to main
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Jobs:**

#### Test Matrix
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: [3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12]
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
```

#### Test Steps
1. Checkout code
2. Setup Python environment
3. Install dependencies (`pip install -e .[test]`)
4. Run pytest with coverage
5. Upload coverage to Codecov

#### Code Quality
1. Run pre-commit hooks
2. Type checking with mypy
3. Security scan with bandit
4. Dependency vulnerability check

### 2. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Schedule: Daily at 2 AM UTC
- Manual dispatch

**Scans:**
- CodeQL analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- SAST with Semgrep
- License compliance check

### 3. Release (`release.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push of version tags (v*)

**Steps:**
1. Build distribution packages
2. Run full test suite
3. Create GitHub release
4. Publish to PyPI (with approval)
5. Update documentation

### 4. Documentation (`docs.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to main branch
- Changes to docs/ directory

**Steps:**
1. Build Sphinx documentation
2. Deploy to GitHub Pages
3. Validate all links
4. Check for broken examples

## Security Requirements

### Secrets Management
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN`: PyPI publishing
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Coverage reporting
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: LLM testing (optional)

### Branch Protection
- Require PR reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Restrict push to main branch
- Require up-to-date branches

### Permissions
Use least-privilege principle:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write
  pull-requests: write
```

## Quality Gates

### Code Coverage
- Minimum 80% line coverage
- Fail build if coverage decreases
- Exclude test files from coverage

### Performance
- Benchmark regression tests
- Memory usage monitoring
- Timeout limits for all jobs

### Documentation
- All public APIs documented
- Examples tested and working
- Architecture diagrams updated

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Feature branches deployed to staging
- Integration tests with real theorem provers
- Performance benchmarking

### Production
- Tagged releases only
- Multi-stage deployment
- Rollback capability
- Health checks

## Monitoring

### Build Health
- Success/failure rates
- Build duration trends
- Flaky test detection

### Security
- Vulnerability scan results
- Dependency update notifications
- Security advisory monitoring

## Example Workflow Structure

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -e .[test]
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest --cov=formal_circuits_gpt --cov-report=xml
      
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

## Integration Requirements

### External Services
- **Codecov**: Code coverage reporting
- **GitHub Pages**: Documentation hosting
- **PyPI**: Package distribution
- **Dependabot**: Dependency updates

### Notifications
- Slack/Discord integration for build status
- Email notifications for security alerts
- PR status updates

## Compliance

### License Scanning
- Ensure all dependencies have compatible licenses
- Generate SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
- Monitor for license changes

### Audit Trail
- All deployments logged
- Change approval records
- Security scan history

This CI/CD setup ensures high code quality, security, and reliable deployments while maintaining development velocity.
