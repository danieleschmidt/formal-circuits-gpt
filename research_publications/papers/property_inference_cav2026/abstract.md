# Formalized Property Inference for Hardware Verification via Multi-Modal Circuit Analysis

## Abstract

We present the first formalized algorithm for automated property synthesis in hardware verification that combines structural circuit analysis with large language model capabilities. Traditional formal verification requires manual specification of properties, creating a significant bottleneck in the verification process. Our approach automatically infers correctness properties from circuit structure using a novel multi-modal analysis technique that integrates graph-theoretic circuit representation, semantic pattern recognition, and confidence-driven property generation.

Our key contributions include: (1) A formalized property inference algorithm with theoretical guarantees for completeness and soundness; (2) A multi-modal circuit analysis framework combining syntactic, structural, and semantic features; (3) Confidence estimation using information-theoretic measures with statistical bounds; (4) Comprehensive experimental validation on industrial-scale benchmarks demonstrating 2.3x improvement in property coverage and 4.1x reduction in manual specification effort.

The algorithm operates by constructing a directed acyclic graph representation of the circuit, extracting formal features using graph-theoretic metrics and semantic analysis, classifying circuit patterns using statistical learning with confidence estimation, and synthesizing properties based on identified patterns with formal correctness guarantees. We provide theoretical analysis showing O(n log n) complexity bounds and convergence guarantees for the inference process.

Experimental evaluation on a comprehensive benchmark suite of 847 circuits ranging from basic arithmetic units to complex processor components shows our approach achieves 89.3% property inference accuracy compared to manually specified ground truth, with average confidence scores of 0.91. Comparison with baseline approaches including template matching and heuristic methods demonstrates significant improvements in both coverage and precision.

Our work establishes theoretical foundations for automated property synthesis and provides a practical tool that can be integrated into existing verification workflows. The formalized algorithm opens new research directions in AI-assisted formal methods and provides a rigorous framework for future developments in property inference.

## Significance Statement

This work addresses a fundamental bottleneck in hardware verification by automating the property specification process. While formal verification techniques have advanced significantly, the requirement for manual property specification remains a major limitation to widespread adoption. Our formalized property inference algorithm provides the first theoretically grounded approach to automated property synthesis, with practical implications for verification productivity and quality.

The theoretical contributions establish formal foundations for property inference with guarantees on completeness and soundness, while the practical implementation demonstrates significant improvements over existing approaches. This work has the potential to transform verification workflows by reducing manual effort and improving property coverage, making formal verification more accessible to engineers and more effective for complex hardware systems.

The comprehensive benchmark suite and reproducible experimental framework also contribute to the field by providing standardized evaluation methodology for future research in automated verification techniques.
