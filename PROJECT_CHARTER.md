# Project Charter: Formal-Circuits-GPT

## Problem Statement

Hardware verification remains a significant bottleneck in the semiconductor industry. Traditional formal verification methods require deep expertise in mathematical proof systems, creating a barrier for many hardware engineers. Despite advances in automated verification tools, there exists a gap between the expressiveness needed for complex hardware properties and the accessibility of verification techniques.

## Solution Vision

Formal-Circuits-GPT bridges this gap by leveraging Large Language Models to democratize formal hardware verification. The system automatically generates mathematical proofs of circuit correctness from Verilog/VHDL descriptions, making formal methods accessible to all hardware engineers regardless of their background in formal verification.
