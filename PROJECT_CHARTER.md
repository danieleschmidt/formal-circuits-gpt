# Formal-Circuits-GPT Project Charter

## Executive Summary

Formal-Circuits-GPT is an open-source tool that automates the formal verification of digital circuits using Large Language Models (LLMs). By bridging hardware design languages (Verilog/VHDL) with mathematical theorem provers (Isabelle/Coq), this project enables hardware engineers to verify circuit correctness with unprecedented ease and efficiency.

## Project Vision

**To democratize formal verification of digital circuits by making it accessible, automated, and intelligent through AI-assisted proof generation.**

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges in Hardware Verification

1. **Complexity Barrier**: Formal verification requires deep expertise in mathematical logic and theorem proving
2. **Manual Effort**: Writing formal specifications and proofs is time-consuming and error-prone
3. **Tool Fragmentation**: Existing tools require specialized knowledge and lack integration
4. **Scalability Issues**: Manual verification doesn't scale with increasing circuit complexity
5. **Industry Gap**: Advanced verification techniques remain largely academic

### Business Impact
- **Design Bugs**: Hardware bugs cost 10-100x more to fix post-silicon
- **Time-to-Market**: Verification bottlenecks delay product releases
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Unverified circuits may contain exploitable flaws
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Safety-critical systems require formal verification

## Solution Approach

### Core Innovation
Leverage Large Language Models to automatically generate and refine formal proofs for digital circuit correctness, creating an intelligent bridge between hardware design and mathematical verification.

### Key Differentiators
1. **AI-Powered Automation**: LLMs generate and refine proofs automatically
2. **Multi-Language Support**: Handles both Verilog and VHDL inputs
3. **Dual Backend**: Supports both Isabelle/HOL and Coq theorem provers
4. **Self-Refinement**: Learns from failures to improve proof strategies
5. **Property Inference**: Automatically discovers likely correctness properties
